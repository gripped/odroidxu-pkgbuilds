odroidxu-pkgbuilds
==================

Work in progress. Use at own risk.

If you want HW accelerated (via libhybris) xbmc you need, in this order:

linux-odroid-xu-hybris

libhybris-hwcomposer-odroidxu

xbmc-libhybris-frodo-{mfc|hyb} (or gotham)

and slim as desktop manager or edit /usr/bin/xbmc-standalone and change there.

(I've made separate pkkbuilds for decoding via mfc or libhybris.)

Easiest way is to go to http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=2898
and get the image or follow the instructions there.
